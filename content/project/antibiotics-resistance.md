## Introduction 
Antibiotics either are cytotoxic or cytostatic to the micro-organisms, allowing the body’s natural defences, such as the immune system, to eliminate them. They often act by inhibiting the synthesis of a bacterial cell, synthesis of proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), by a membrane disorganizing agent, or other specific actions. Antibiotics may also enter the cell wall of the bacteria by binding to them, using the energy-dependent transport mechanisms in ribosomal sites, which subsequently lead to the inhibition of the protein synthesis.

## Objectives
- Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training.
- Strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research.
- Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures.
- Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health.
- Develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries and to increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.
