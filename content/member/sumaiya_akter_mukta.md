I am a Microbiology Master’s student at Jagannath University and a Health Data Science enthusiast. Health data science, bioinformatics, public health are some of my research interests. I founded the Health Data Research Organization as well.

The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, which is supervised by university faculty members in the life sciences.

Python is my go-to language for data mining and machine learning. I also have a limited understanding of R and SQL
