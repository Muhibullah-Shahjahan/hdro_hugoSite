I am a Microbiology Honour’s student at Jagannath University. Health data science, bioinformatics, public health are some of my research interests. I am a member of the Health Data Research Organization as well. The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data.

I have a little experiences on python so python is my go-to language for data mining and machine learning.
