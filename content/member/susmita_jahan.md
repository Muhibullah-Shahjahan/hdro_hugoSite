I am a Microbiology honours student at Jagannath
University and a Health Data Science enthusiast. Health data science, bioinformatics, public health are some of my research interests. I am a member of the Health Data Research Organization as well.

The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, which is supervised by university faculty members in the life sciences.

I have limited understanding of R and SQL.
