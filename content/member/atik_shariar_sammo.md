I am Sammo, Md. Atik Shahriar Sammo. I am a 3rd year student at Jagannath University in Microbiology department. Health data science,
bioinformatics, public health is some of my research interests.

The Health Data Research Organization (HDRO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, which is supervised by university faculty members in the life sciences.

I think I have a good Knowledge about Python & I also have a limited understanding of R.
