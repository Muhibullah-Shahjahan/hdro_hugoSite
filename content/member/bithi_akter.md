I  am a student in the faculty of Microbiology at Jagannath University. I am interested in Health data science & Industrial Microbiology. I am a research assistant  of  Health Data Research Organization (HDRO).The Health Data Research Organization  is a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research and dissemination using primary and secondary sources as well as third-party data. Students and young professionals with expertise in biological science and health science run the organization, which is supervised by the university faculty members in the life sciences.

Python is my go-to language for data mining. I also have a limited understanding of R.
