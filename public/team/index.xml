      <description>Intelligent behaviour fascinates me: how animals can efficiently process a flood of sensory signals and learn to survive. Nature has produced elegant solutions for information processing that I believe can help us tackle challenges in modern society. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about taking what we know from how brains process information, to making intelligent machines.
My work in the lab focuses on deploying our agents to mobile robotics applications. I collaborate with industry to solve practical problems using free energy minimisation and I collaborate with researchers in control systems and robotics to study how neuro-biological processes of action and perception can be used for engineering.</description>
