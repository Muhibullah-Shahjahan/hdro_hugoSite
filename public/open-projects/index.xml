      <title>MSc graduation project: Intelligent behavior through cooperating agents</title>

      <description>Problem description Autonomous guidance is becoming more widely adopted in mobile robotics applications. Factory bots can find their own way from production lines to storage facilities and police drones can scout and search areas without an operator. In many applications, having more than one agent can prove beneficial. For instance, when searching an area, more agents cover more ground (see also Figure 1). But they need to communicate and coordinate. This graduation project will focus on coordination and planning across multiple agents.</description>

      <title>MSc graduation project: Bayesian machine learning on a neuromorphic chip</title>

      <description>Problem description Modern intelligent systems are typically deployed on hardware with extensive computational resources, for example GPU stacks in self-driving cars. As machine learning becomes more ingrained into engineering, the need rises for specialized hardware in which learning algorithms can be deployed efficiently. One strategy is to look to the brain for inspiration. Neuromorphic computing architectures are designed to support learning algorithms in a power- and memory-efficient manner. GrAI Matter Labs is a startup located partly at the High Tech Campus Eindhoven, which develops chips with neuromorphic processor architectures [1].</description>

      <title>MSc graduation project: System identification with Bayesian machine learning</title>
      <link>https://hdrobd.github.io/open-projects/msc-nonlinear-system-identification-through-bayesian-machine-learning/</link>

      <description>Problem description System identification is concerned with estimating a dynamical model from paired input and output data. In particular, we are considering an electro-mechanical positioning system (EMPS), where a motor drives a small platform on a track between two points (a prismatic joint) [1]. These are ubiquitous in robotics and machine tool applications, but can be challenging to control when non-linearities such as friction are involved. Our goal is to estimate the inverse dynamical model (torque/force as a function of position, velocity and acceleration), outperforming the current least-squares baseline approach.</description>

      <description>Context  BIASlab logo   BIASlab (Fig.1, http://biaslab.org, FLUX-7.060) is a subgroup of the Signal Processing Systems (SPS) that aims to develop Intelligent Autonomous Agents (IA). These agents interact with their environment through their sensors and actuators in order to learn purposeful behavior, e.g., to navigate, play soccer or they may learn to decode speech signals under bad acoustic conditions. Our research projects are inspired by the latest insights from machine learning, computational neuroscience and signal processing.</description>
